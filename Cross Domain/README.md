# Cross Domain Automation Workflows

This directory contains automation workflows designed to operate across multiple network domains, platforms, and technologies. These workflows provide integration capabilities and orchestration between different Cisco platforms and third-party systems to enable comprehensive network automation.

## Purpose

The Cross Domain directory serves as a repository for workflows that:

- **Integrate Multiple Platforms**: Workflows that coordinate operations across different Cisco platforms (Catalyst Center, Meraki, SD-WAN, etc.)
- **Bridge Technology Domains**: Automation that spans Campus, Data Center, Cloud, and WAN domains
- **Orchestrate Complex Operations**: Multi-step workflows that require coordination between different network management systems
- **Provide End-to-End Automation**: Complete automation solutions that span the entire network infrastructure lifecycle

## Workflow Categories

### Multi-Platform Integration

Workflows that integrate and coordinate operations between different Cisco platforms:

- **Campus to Cloud**: Integration between on-premises campus networks and cloud-based services
- **SD-Access to SD-WAN**: Workflows connecting Software Defined Access fabrics with SD-WAN deployments
- **Data Center Integration**: Workflows that bridge campus networks with data center infrastructure
- **Security Integration**: Cross-platform security policy enforcement and threat response

### Technology Domain Bridging

Workflows that operate across different technology domains:

- **Wired and Wireless**: Unified management workflows for both wired and wireless infrastructure
- **Physical and Virtual**: Integration between physical network devices and virtual network functions
- **On-Premises and Cloud**: Hybrid network automation spanning local and cloud environments
- **Legacy and Modern**: Workflows that integrate legacy systems with modern network platforms

### Service Orchestration

Complex workflows that orchestrate services across multiple domains:

- **User Onboarding**: End-to-end user provisioning across all network domains
- **Incident Response**: Automated incident response workflows spanning multiple platforms
- **Change Management**: Coordinated change implementation across network domains
- **Compliance Reporting**: Cross-domain compliance validation and reporting

## Integration Capabilities

### Platform Connectivity

- **API Integration**: REST API calls to multiple Cisco platforms
- **Authentication Management**: Centralized credential management for multi-platform access
- **Data Synchronization**: Consistent data exchange between different management systems
- **Event Correlation**: Cross-platform event monitoring and correlation

### Third-Party Integration

- **ITSM Systems**: Integration with IT Service Management platforms
- **Monitoring Tools**: Integration with network monitoring and analytics platforms
- **Security Platforms**: Integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems
- **Cloud Services**: Integration with public cloud providers and services

## Use Cases

### Network Transformation

- **Brownfield Modernization**: Workflows for gradually migrating legacy networks to modern architectures
- **Hybrid Deployments**: Managing mixed environments with both traditional and software-defined networking
- **Technology Refresh**: Coordinated hardware and software refresh across multiple domains

### Operational Efficiency

- **Automated Provisioning**: End-to-end service provisioning across all network domains
- **Centralized Management**: Unified workflows for managing distributed network infrastructure
- **Policy Consistency**: Ensuring consistent policy enforcement across different platforms

### Business Continuity

- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-domain disaster recovery and business continuity workflows
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic management and load distribution across multiple domains
- **Failover Automation**: Automated failover and recovery procedures

## Prerequisites

### Platform Access

- Authentication credentials for all target platforms
- Appropriate API access and permissions on each system
- Network connectivity between automation platform and target systems
