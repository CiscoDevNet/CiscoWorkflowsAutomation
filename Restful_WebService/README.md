# RESTful Web Service Integration Workflows

This directory contains automation workflows that demonstrate how Cisco Workflows Automation integrates with Web Services exposing RESTful APIs. These workflows showcase the core capabilities for HTTP request handling, API authentication, data processing, and integration patterns that can be applied across various external services and platforms.

## Purpose

The RESTful Web Service directory serves as a repository for workflows that:

- **Demonstrate API Integration**: Show practical examples of integrating with external RESTful web services
- **Showcase HTTP Request Handling**: Illustrate core HTTP request capabilities including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- **Enable External Service Integration**: Bridge Cisco network automation with third-party services and platforms

## HTTP Request Capabilities

### Core HTTP Operations

Workflows demonstrating fundamental HTTP request handling:

- **GET Requests**: Retrieving data from external APIs and services
- **POST Requests**: Sending data to create new resources or trigger actions
- **PUT Requests**: Updating existing resources through API calls
- **DELETE Requests**: Removing resources via API endpoints
- **PATCH Requests**: Partial updates and modifications through APIs

### Authentication Methods

Examples of various API authentication patterns:

- **API Key Authentication**: Simple API key-based authentication methods
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: OAuth and JWT token-based authentication
- **Basic Authentication**: Username and password authentication schemes
- **Custom Headers**: Custom authentication headers and security tokens
- **OAuth 2.0 Flows**: Complete OAuth 2.0 authorization code and client credential flows

### Request Handling Features

Advanced HTTP request handling capabilities:

- **Request Headers**: Custom header management and manipulation
- **Query Parameters**: Dynamic query parameter construction and encoding
- **Request Body Processing**: JSON, XML, and form-data payload handling
- **Response Processing**: Parsing and extracting data from API responses
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for HTTP status codes and API errors

## Current Workflows

### Weather Service Integration

- **Get Weather Forecast** - Demonstrates integration with external weather APIs
  - RESTful API consumption using HTTP GET requests
  - JSON response parsing and data extraction
  - Error handling for API failures and invalid responses
  - Dynamic parameter passing for location-based queries

## Integration Patterns

### Data Exchange Patterns

Common patterns for data exchange with RESTful APIs:

- **Request-Response**: Synchronous API calls with immediate response processing
- **Polling**: Periodic API polling for status updates and data changes
- **Webhook Integration**: Handling incoming webhook requests from external services
- **Batch Processing**: Bulk data operations through API batch endpoints
- **Pagination Handling**: Managing paginated API responses for large datasets

### Error Handling and Resilience

Robust patterns for handling API integration challenges:

- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- **Circuit Breaker**: Circuit breaker patterns for API fault tolerance
- **Timeout Management**: Proper timeout handling for slow or unresponsive APIs
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect for API rate limits and throttling
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable

### Security Considerations

Security best practices for API integration:

- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and handling of API credentials
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensuring secure communication with HTTPS
- **Input Validation**: Validating data before sending to external APIs
- **Response Sanitization**: Cleaning and validating API response data
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of API interactions for security monitoring

## External Service Integration

Common scenarios for RESTful web service integration:

- **Third-Party APIs**: Integration with external vendor APIs and services
- **Cloud Services**: Connectivity with cloud platform APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Monitoring Services**: Integration with external monitoring and alerting platforms
- **ITSM Integration**: Connectivity with IT Service Management platforms
- **Data Sources**: Accessing external data sources and information services
